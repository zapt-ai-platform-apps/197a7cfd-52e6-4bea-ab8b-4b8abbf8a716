# Swipe Task Actions Journey

This journey explains how to use swipe gestures on tasks for quick actions.

1. **View Your Task List:**  
   Your tasks are displayed in a scrollable list on the main screen.

2. **Swipe Right to Mark Complete:**  
   Touch a task and swipe right (a horizontal swipe exceeding 50 pixels) to mark the task as complete. Completed tasks will show a line-through and a different background, indicating they are done.

3. **Swipe Left to Delete:**  
   Touch a task and swipe left (a horizontal swipe exceeding 50 pixels) to delete the task from your list.

4. **Visual and Console Feedback:**  
   The app logs each swipe gesture in the developer console for debugging and immediate visual feedback is provided based on the action performed.
